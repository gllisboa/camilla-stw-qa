## A ) Scope of Work:
> * The target of this work, is to run a functional tests to the "DDD- Forum" Web App. Popular Posts View feature and to assertain if the sorting functionality is working as expected in accordance to the business rules. 
> * The tests wil be conducted manualy and in a controlled environment.
> * Diferent test cases will be considered for diferent use scenarios, through the insertion of static & valid parameters directly in the database-
> * The Web App "DDD- Forum" will be used in tandem with the data insertion in order to validate the results obtained.

## B ) System Set-Up :

### B.1 - Front-End & Back-End Start-up:

1. Copy the `.env` template file. Feel free to change passwords and app secrets. 
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

2. Build and run the image to run the backend services.
```bash
docker-compose up
```

3. Open up an additional console and then run:

```bash	
npm run setup:dev
```

```bash	
npm run start:both
```

### B.2 - Test Pre-conditions :
Prior to running the test it is required to clean the database, for such, run the following commands in a sequencial manner:

```bash	
npm run db:delete:dev
```

```bash
npm run db:create:dev
```

```bash
npm run db:migrate:dev
```

## B.3 - Instructions for running the test:

### How to Admin the database

    - db name: data_dev
  
  2. With MySQL desktop, open the SQL script file for each respective test case. SQL files, can be found onn the project folder, under the following directory: 
  ```bash	
  src/func_test/DB_MySQL
  ```

  3. Further MySQL settings required to run the script:

  4. Run the script directy on MySQL desktop.
 
 ## B.4 - After Running the test:

 1. Stop the containers by running:

```bash	
docker-compose stop
```

2. Stop the backend by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal where the backend is running.

# C ) Functional Tests:

# 1 - CASE-A

## 1.1 - Test Case :
* According to the DDD-Forum Web Application, it is expected that the posts are ordered by popularity, where the popularity is defined by the number of votes. The posts with the highest number of votes should be displayed first.

* The test "CASE -A" has been defined in order to test the compliance with the application requirements and business rules :

  * The test aims to verify the correct order of the posts.

  * This will be a functional test conducted manually by the Tester.

  * The test will be condutcted in controlled fashion and orderly manner.

  * It required to require to run both the Front-End and Back-End services (Instructions available below).

  * It is required to clean the database prior to running the test (Instructions available below).

  * It is required to Admin the database in order to bypass the Front-End and insert the data directly in the DB (Instructions available above).

  * Parameters concerning 6 post with diferent Titles, Texts and Number of votes will be injected directly in the database through a "SQL" script file as follows:


##  1.2 - Input data :

| Insertion order:| Title                   | Text                       | Number of Votes :    |

  - The data is organized in descending order of popularity based on votes, ranging from the highest to the lowest voted. 
  
  - Users can access the platform or website and navigate to the section where user-submitted content is located. 
  
  - The data is sorted where the most voted posts are shown first, and if there are posts with same number of votes these are sorted by post_id value. 
  
  - It's important to note that the sorting is dynamic since new votes are cast.
