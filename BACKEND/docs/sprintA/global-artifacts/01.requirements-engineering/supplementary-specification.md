## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:_
- _are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._

- Use cookies to track users;
- When a user tries to access a non existing page it should return a blank page;
- Use JWT tokens to grant access to the forum;
- Login and Logout should be possible.
- Uses DTOÂ´s in the communication of sensitive data between the client and the server;


## Usability

_Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,
among them: error prevention; interface aesthetics and design; help and
documentation; consistency and standards._


 - Intuitive interface: The forum has a user-friendly design with clear navigation menus and intuitive controls.
 - Responsive design: The forum is accessible and adapts to different screen sizes.
 - Rich text formatting: Users can apply formatting options (e.g., bold, italic, url links and code format) while creating posts.
 - Allow to post images: Users can post small images in their posts and comments.
 


## Reliability
_Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures._


- High availability: The forum is accessible and operational with minimal downtime.
- Error handling: The forum  handles errors and provides helpful messages to users.
- Concurrent user handling: The forum can handle multiple users interacting simultaneously without issues.


## Performance
_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._

- Fast page loading: The forum has optimized page loading times and responsive user interactions.
- Efficient database queries: Database queries are optimized to retrieve forum data quickly.


## Supportability
_The supportability requirements gathers several characteristics, such as:
testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,
configurability, installability, scalability and more._ 

- User feedback and bug reporting: Users can provide feedback and report bugs for continuous improvement.
- Compatibility: The forum is compatible with popular web browsers and operating systems.
- Scalability: The forum can handle a large number of users and forum activity.
