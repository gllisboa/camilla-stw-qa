<br>

>* **Question:** Do you want that information to be displayed in already existant pages/fields and if so, which? or in a new page?

>* **Answer:**  I want the Statistics web page to be a brand new page in the Web Application.

<br>

>* **Question** Where do you want the access of the brand new "Statistics Web Page" to be located? 

>* **Answer:** I want the access to the "Statistics" web page to be made available through the main page.

<br>

>* **Question:** On the main page, where do you want the "Statistics" access field to be placed? at the header? In the footer? In the body? on a sidebar? In the menu? or any Other?

>* **Answer:** I want to access the new page through a "Statistics" button.

<br>

>* **Questions:** In terms of UI layout of the field concerning "average of a posts per user for a Specific Day" in the "Statistics" web page, do you want itÂ´s position in the page to follow the same sequence as the sequence presented initialy for all additional functionalities to be implemented in the "Statistics" web page? Or do you have another preference?
 
>* **Answer:** It can follow the sequence of additional statistic functionalities stated by me initialy.

<br>

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![USXXX-CD](USXXX-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*

# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
