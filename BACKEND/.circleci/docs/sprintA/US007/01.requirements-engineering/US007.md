### 1.8 Bugs

#### **A - Bug Comment to post created with 1 vote**

**A.1 - Description:**

* When creating the comment, it is automatically assigned 1 up vote.

**A.2 - Detailed Description:**

* Every time a new comment is created it already has 1 positive vote related to it instead of 0 votes, the expected behavior would be to have the comment created with 0 votes.

 **A.3 - Failed Acceptance Criterias:**

* [AC4](/docs/sprintA/US007/01.requirements-engineering/US007.md#13-acceptance-criteria)


**A.4 - Sequence Diagram**

![**Create Comment to Post - Sequence Diagram**](/docs/sprintC/svg/createpostcomment.svg)

**A.5 - Severity:**

* **Medium**

**A.6 - Current Behaviour:**

* when the comment is posted, the vote start at 1

**A.7 - Expected Behaviour:**

*  when the comment is posted, the vote should start at zero


**A.8 - Date and Time of Occurrence:**

* September 21, 2023, at 9:00 PM 

**A.9 - Steps to Reproduce the Issue:**

The steps to produce the bug are:

>1. Access the application

>2. Select a post

>3. Type a comment in the comments text box.


**A.10 - Status:**

* **Bug Resolved**


**A.11 - Code Modification in "comment":**


  * These modifications were implemented to ensure that
 the comment is created with zero votes. Now comments are created correctly with zero votes according to the established conditions*

  ```typescript

export class Comment extends Entity<CommentProps> {
// ... (code)
public static create(props: CommentProps, id?: UniqueEntityID): Result<Comment> {
 // ... (code)
  const defaultCommentProps: CommentProps = {
    ...props,
    points: 0, // Setting points initially to 0
    votes: CommentVotes.create([]) // Creating a new empty vote set
    const comment = new Comment(defaultCommentProps, id);

      return Result.ok<Comment>(comment);
    }
  }
}  
```

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.* 

![USXXX-MD](USXXX-MD.svg)

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              
| Step 7  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 8  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 9  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 10  		 |							 |             |                              |  


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![USXXX-CD](USXXX-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*

# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
