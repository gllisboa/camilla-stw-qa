# US022 -  Highlight 1/3 less commented

<!--Test  to commit due to probaly python version issues 22-10-2023-->

### 1. Requirements Engineering
* As a member, when I open the recent posts section, I want all the posts that have less than 1/3 of the comments from the post with the highest comments on the recent posts page to be highlighted with a red background, so that the posts the less commented posts are visually identified.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications
The most recent posts webpage presents the recently inserted posts on the applicatiopn, nevertheless among these most recent posts, some will have more comments and others. In order for the user to identify the less relevant posts among these recent ones, it's necessary to highlight the less commented. In this sense, the goal of this feature is to highlight the less commented posts among the recent ones. The less commented posts are the ones that have 1/3 or less comments when compared with the post with most comments.

**From the client clarifications:**

>**Question:** Should all posts be considered?
>**Answer:** No, only the posts visible on the Recent Posts area must be considered.

>**Question:** What is the value used as base to calculate 1/3 from?
>**Answer:**   The value to calculate 1/3 from should be the ammount of comments of the most commented post on the Recent Post section..

>**Question:** How to identify the less commented post?
>**Answer:** From the list on the Recent Posts section, identify the posts in which the amount of comments is equal or less then 1/3 of the the amount of comments on the most commented post.

>**Question:** How must the less commeted post be highlighted?
>**Answer:** The less commented posts must be highlighted in red.

>**Question:** What to do if no posts has 1/3 or less commentes?
>**Answer:** If no posts has less than 1/3 or less of the amount os comments of the most commented post, no post should be higlhlight.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1:** Given that there are posts on the recent posts area, when the user opens the recent posts section, then the 1/3 least commentd posts must be highlighted in red.

- **AC2:** Given that there are no posts commented on the recent posts area, when the user opens the recent posts section, then there should be nos highlighted.

- **AC3:** Given that all the posts on the recent posts area present the same amount of comments, when the user opens the recent posts section, then no post should be highlighted.

- **AC4:** Given that there is only one post on the recent posts area, when the user opens the recent posts section, then no post should be highlighted.

- **Teste Cases:**

 @CT-001 -> AC4
 - Scenario: Single post in the recent posts section
 - Given I am on the login page
 - And I login with <username> and <password>
 - When I have just 1 post in the recent posts section
 - And I go to New posts in the recent posts section
 - Then I should not see any posts highlighted with a red background

  @Ct-002 - AC2
 - Scenario: No posts highlighted when all posts are highly commented
 -	Given I am on the login page
 -	And I login with <username> and <password>
 - 	And I have no posts with one third or less of the total comments
 -	When I go to New posts in the recent posts section
 - Then I should not see any posts highlighted with a red background
   
  @CT-003 - AC1 & AC3
  Scenario: Highlight less commented posts in the recent posts section
 - Given I am on the login page
 - When I login with <username> and <password>
 - When I have posts with one third or less of the total comments
 - And I go to New posts in the recent posts section
 - Then I should see the posts with one third or less of the total comments must be highlighted with a red background

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

[*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* ]


## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*

# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
