### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- In this user story, data manipulation was exclusively carried out on the frontend using React Moment. The objective was to apply a red color style to posts (date) that were created more than five days ago within the Post module's components: PostMeta, PostSummary, and PostRow.

- There was no implementation on the backend, such as creating routes, integration testing, or sequence diagrams (SD) for this functionality. The handling of data regarding post age was solely addressed on the frontend.
