# US013 - Delete User


## 1. Requirements Engineering
* As a member, I want to have a delete button on the the Member Details area, so that I can delete a user.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications
Currently it is not possible to delete user, so once a user is created it cannot be removed from the application. In order to allow for better members management its necessary to create a user delete feature that enables users or admins to delete a user profile.

**From the client clarifications:**

>**Question:** Who can delete a user?
>**Answer:**  Only members or Admins can delete profiles.

>**Question:** Which information is necessary to delete a user?
>**Answer:** Only the member Username is required.

>**Question:** How can a user be deleted?
>**Answer:** A Delete button must be available on the Member Details area.

>**Question:** What if the username doesnÂ´t exist?
>**Answer:** A message must be returned saying the profile is non-existent.

>**Question:** When can a user be deleted?
>**Answer:** Anytime a logged user acess the Member Details area the delete button must be available.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1:** Create a member account.
- **AC2:** Have an active login.
- **AC3:** Be on the members' page.
- **AC4:** Activate the deletion button (which should disappear automatically under certain conditions).
- **AC4.1:** Conditions to display the deletion button: not being deleted, having no posts, or comments.
- **AC4.2:** If there are no users under the deletion conditions, display the message "No users available."

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

 - The user deletion feature, in conjunction with deleteUser, removes members based on their usernames.
 - Backend operations involve a separate function creating a list of usernames meeting deletion criteria: not marked as is_deleted and lacking posts or comments.
 - Frontend interaction presents a deletion button upon detecting an eligible username, marking the profile as is_deleted.
 - Profiles marked as deleted are barred from system access, prompting an error message advising the creation of a new account.
- Backend separation ensures organized user management, while frontend interaction is streamlined for a superior user experience.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer | Justification (with patterns) |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :----- | :---------------------------- |
| Step 1         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 2         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 3         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 4         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 5         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 6         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 7         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 8         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 9         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 10        |                                             |        |                               |

### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- Class1
- Class2
- Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- xxxxUI
- xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement._

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods._

![USXXX-CD](USXXX-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests

_In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling._

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    	public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
    	Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
    }

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

_In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits._

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._

# 6. Integration and Demo

_In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system._

# 7. Observations

_In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work._
