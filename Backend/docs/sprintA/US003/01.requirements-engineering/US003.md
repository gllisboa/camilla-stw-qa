*Provide the user-entered data here.*

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

User views the info

    User -> System : asks to view the member information
    activate System


System gives access to view the info

        System --> User : gives the access to view the infortmation
    deactivate System

User checks for any flaws and validates

    User -> System : checks if everything is up to date and saves the information.
    activate System

System validates the action from the user

        System --> User : validates the action from the user.
    deactivate System

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

## 4.1. Test Cases

**Test 1:** Verify that clicking on the "Member Info" button from the account dashboard takes the user to the Member Info page.
**Test 2:** Confirm that the user's name, email address, and username are displayed accurately on the Member Info page.
**Test 3:** Check that the profile picture or avatar is displayed correctly on the Member Info page.
**Test 4:** Test that the user's membership level or status is displayed correctly on the Member Info page.
**Test 5:** Ensure that the layout of the Member Info page is clear and easy to navigate.
**Test 6:** Verify that all information presented on the Member Info page is up-to-date and accurate.
**Test 7:** Test that the user can edit their personal information, such as their name or email address, directly from the Member Info page.
**Test 8:** Check that any changes made by the user to their personal information are immediately reflected on the site.
**Test 9:** Test that any changes made by the user are saved securely and properly.
**Test 10:** Make sure that access to the Member Info page is limited to the user and authorized website administrators only.


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*Determine the requirements*

*Design the UI*

*Develop the database*

*Build the back-end*

*Develop the front end*

*Test the system*

*Deploy the system*

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*Integration:*

Develop a module that allows authorized users to access member information;
Determine the appropriate level of security required to access the information;
Integrate the module with the existing system architecture;	

*Demonstration:*

Access the module through a user interface;
Select a specific member to view their information;
Verify that the information displayed is accurate and up-to-date;
Highlight any additional features such as filtering or sorting options;
Address any questions or concerns from stakeholders regarding the module;

# 7. Observations

*Additionally, future work related to viewing member information could focus on improving the accessibility of the information. For example, adding voice interactions or increasing compatibility with screen readers can help users with disabilities more easily access their member information.*

*Another area for potential future work is in enhancing the security of member information. As cyber threats continue to evolve, it is important to ensure that sensitive information such as member addresses and payment details are kept secure and protected from unauthorized access.*
